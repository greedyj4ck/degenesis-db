{"name":"Nullbox","permission":{"default":0,"U6pJfvAVEvXjcI3X":3},"type":"equipment","data":{"description":"Under normal circumstances a Rift will dissolve upon the death of its creator, but in some rare cases small pockets remain. One of the most reliable ways to trap a Rift is inside a small box, lined with the flayed skin of a freshly killed Psychokinetic. By closing the box inside a Rift, a fraction of its properties become trapped inside. Vigilantes and Anabaptists are known to use such artificial Rifts as part of their rituals. Purgan Anabaptists in particular utilize such boxes as tests of faith for the most devout. A hand sized hole is carved into one of its sides as an opening. As the tested one places his hand inside they will be subjected to a barrage of terrifying feelings as the space within the box distorts and shifts reality according to an unknown set of impulses. Some experience bone-chilling cold, scorching heat, crushing gravity, or pressure that threatens to pull the skin away from the muscle beneath. Only the most faithful and brave souls can hope to resist the urge to pull their hand out of such a Nullbox. \nLEGENDS: Difficulty (4) \nDETERIORATION: Variable \nHARVEST: To create a Nullbox two components are required: a dead Psychokinetic whose skin must be flayed and strapped across the interior of the premade box, and a Rift still lingering around after the death of its master. All this must be achieved within the complete darkness of the Rift, imparting a Vision penalty of -4D to the harvest roll. The intensity of the Rift is dependent on the Psychokinetic’s power level. Rifts made by Hylikoi rarely last for longer than (6) Rounds. An Archon’s Rift, on the other hand, is fueled with enough energy to stay active for a minimum of (30) Rounds after his death. To trap the Rift, the box simply needs to be closed, and eventually sealed with bee’s wax or similar glue. Once a hole is drilled into the side, allowing someone to slip their hand through, the Nullbox is finished. A character conducting a test of faith has to roll a series of Mental Defenses throughout the duration of their test, once per Round at Difficulty (5). After each roll the character being tested may choose to spend (3) Ego Points in exchange for (1) additional Success. There is no limit to the Ego Points that can be spent in this fashion. The mental torture lasts until they are allowed to remove their hand by the administrator of the test, at which point they regain all Ego Points, filled with determination from enduring fears and feelings from beyond what is natural, as well as (1) additional point of Authority among their Cult members. Failure of the test will always result in a loss of (1) point of Authority. The true reason why Anabaptists use the Nullbox is to spot Infiltrators among their ranks: should anyone with nanites coursing through their bloodstream place their hand inside a Nullbox, they will be subject to a far more painful experience. The nanites lose their reference frame and go haywire, dealing (5) Flesh Wounds per Round while the hand is resting within the box.

Legends tell of the Stukov Nomads using the ritual as a test of endurance and strength for their tribal leaders, but among the Brenni of Justitian it is instead used to cleanse their patients of anything from poisons and parasites to spore infestation. First, the patient is invited to drink a bowl of water, in order to hydrate himself. The practitioner doesn’t reveal that the liquid is infected with Dust Worm larvae. The larvae themselves are tasteless, and would be harmless under normal circumstances - simply growing into full Dust Worms inside the body, causing the host to feel the urge to gorge themselves on food and water. The ritual continues three days later. In the interval, the patient is prescribed an herbal concoction that must be drank three times each day. The blue colored and lilac scented liquid is no cure: it is a chemical mixture designed to enhance the larvae’s growth, while hindering its reproductive cycle. This allows the Dust Worm to filter the blood of toxins, while giving the host a chance to survive the next stage. On the third day, the patient reunites with the healer. The patient is strapped down, for his own safety, before being stung in the belly with a needle coated in the venom of the Stukov Scorpion. Terrifying stories of the life cycles of the creatures inhabiting the Stukov Desert are often told as warnings to avoid the salty expanse. Anyone stung by a Stukov Scorpion after being infested by a Dust Worm will endure a painful and gruesome death as the rapidly growing worm ruptures their organs while larvae burst from every orifice. Only the medicine the host has been drinking, along with a robust constitution, stand between his life and death. If the procedure was carried out properly, the worm will be unable to produce larvae and only swell a small amount as it is flushed from the body, along with the toxins it has absorbed. In Brennen, one of the founding districts of Justitian’s Downtown, the healer dynasties have managed to retain the knowledge of the recipes and dosage required for the Red Purge to be successful.

Desperate Guerreros are often forced into the Warpage, and some of them never return once passing its border. Those that do make it back occasionally return with artifacts of another time, which have many bizarre properties.

What makes Stall so valuable is its ability to temporarily quell the effects of spore infestation. The Spitalians considered it a success, until they learned that consistent dosing will lead to a painful and bizarre death. Despite Stall inhibiting the visible effects of the Sepsis, the infestation boils under the surface and will lead to the body shutting itself down as it desperately tries to contact the Chakra collective and fails. Such a death is no better than just setting the infested ablaze. The Apocalyptics, however, found an immediate market for the damned liquor. Those under the effects of Stall have a far easier time hiding their stigmata, becoming invisible to the Mollusks and other tests for spore infestation short of a direct biopsy. The Spitalians consider Stall to be almost as much a curse as Burn itself, and anyone caught producing or using it will find themselves at a Splayer’s tip.

When the Ravee deteriorates, it disintegrates inside the body with a spray of potent acid dealing (5) Flesh Wounds. The Ravee stays fresh outside the body for three days before it desiccates. A fresh gland grants a permanent increase of (+1) BOD, at the cost of (3) points of permanent spore infestation, while a dried gland will grant (+1) BOD for a day, along with 1D spore infestation. Whether fresh or dry the gland must be properly wrapped into a goat bladder or some other thin membrane before consumption: if the toxins contained inside the Ravee touch any part of the subjects pharynx, tongue, or saliva while swallowing, it causes a deadly reaction. The affected flesh swells up, riddled with unnatural muscle cramps immediately clogging the windpipe, while Sepsis mushrooms into the throat, asphyxiating the brave warrior in less than a few heartbeats. Only if a wrapped Ravee reaches the stomach can the toxins be slowly dissolved by the gastric acids to release the gland’s unnatural benefits into the host body.","quantity":1,"encumbrance":0,"tech":0,"value":"2200","resources":0,"cult":"","location":"","group":"psychonauticRemains","effect":"Enhances BOD Attribute, Legends (3), Deterioration (5) rounds"},"flags":{},"img":"systems/degenesis/icons/items/equipment/ravee.svg","effects":[],"_id":"v658K1D0dUpVrYTV"}

This energy sometimes gets trapped inside the heart, burning hotter and hotter, taking months to fully dissipate even after the Psychokinetic has ceased to exist. A legend tells of the Anabaptist Yondar who fought his way through a Psychokinetic’s Rift, weathering blow after blow of rupturing energy searing his flesh and Filaments cutting him to the bone, until he finally reached the epicenter. With one blow from his bidenhander, the full might of the Pneuma assisting him, he massacred the Aberrant inside. However, Yondar’s body was ravaged and his heart on the brink of failure. In one last desperate attempt to stay alive the Furor shattered his foe’s ribcage, yanked out the thumping muscle inside, and pressed it against his chest. The leftover electricity in the heart defibrillated his own and jolted him back to senses.
