      "description": "Those who carry a hide-covered oval shield into battle do not follow the rules of modern warfare, but the commands of tradition. The assault rifle remains in camp, wrapped in oiled cloth, and instead the warrior chooses shield and spear. This way, he walks the path of the ancient ancestors, degrading the enemy to the level of an animal and the war to a hunt.",
