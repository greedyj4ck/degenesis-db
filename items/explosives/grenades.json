There are different smoke colors and it is important to keep in mind that smoke grenades are used by the Hellvetics for signaling as well. When the wind conditions are appropriate or if used in interior rooms, the smoke reduces visibility to an arm‘s length within 1 D6 rounds, which makes it much easier to retreat. One could also use this opportunity to force the opponent to enter into close combat.",
