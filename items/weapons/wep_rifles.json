      "description": "The repeating air rifle is made of salvaged components put together in a delicate balance, but it is still used by Scrappers and Clanners throughout the Protectorate and beyond due to its simple manufacture and the lack of gunpowder or other propellant necessary, instead firing its bullets with compressed air. As such, it is almost completely silent when shot. These rifles feature an internal air reservoir and a magazine capable of holding several bullets. Reloads are an issue however, as it takes a full hour to pressurize the reservoir and refill the magazine.",

      "description": "A general term for a family of pre-Eshaton rifles firing a small-caliber detonating munition, the Fragger is an early generation smartgun. Fraggers are often found completely by accident, as despite the advanced interface systems contained within the weapon, from the outside they appear completely indistinguishable from any other rifle. Instead, the projectiles themselves are the element that differs. They have infrared and range-finding sensors capable of microsecond-scale updates, scanning for body heat. If the temperature of the target is above or below that of the human body, the projectile remains solid to punch through the armor or surface. On the other hand, if the temperature is within a few degrees of a person’s average body temperature, then the Fragger round breaks apart with a crack, and the resulting shrapnel enters the body. The damage dealt in this way is devastating, as the projectile is designed to shatter into about a dozen tiny, razor sharp shards.",
