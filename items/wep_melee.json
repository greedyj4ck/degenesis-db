Supposedly, the plug-ins that are usually seen today served as interfaces for AMSUMOs to control the blades. The functionality remains: in the shaft, there is a kinetic storage cylinder that is fueled by the pumping of a lever, which spreads the blades. If the lever is pushed out, the outer blades close quickly and forcefully over the middle blade. Various attachments can be screwed on top of the shaft, though usually a Mollusk container is chosen.",

The 2T used are not factored into the Damage calculation, so if the Player rolls only a 1 for the additional Damage, he does (1) point of Damage less than if he had not used “Cutting”. However, in the best case he can do (4) extra points of Damage."

The long polearm is the height of two or three men, and requires both hands to wield, but this length allows it to reach riders mounted on tall horses. However, should an enemy be able to slip past the spearhead the length of the weapon becomes its biggest flaw unless the pike is dropped and the intruder dealt with by other means.",

When activated, these elaborate designs are revealed to be two smaller blades pushed out by springs from the main blade, forming a fan of knives used to parry an opponent’s weapon. The swordbreaker is often used by duelists with a flair for the dramatic, or Apocalyptics attempting to disarm their enemies prior to capture and interrogation. The additional blades allow an assassin to cause extra harm, but the added weight and price of the weapon makes it an undesirable killing tool.",
